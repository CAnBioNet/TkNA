Reconstruction and analysis of a network
Note that the following must be ran from the network_analysis directory that was created when you cloned the repo to your analysis directory above. 
1. Import the data and metadata for the run
	Usage
		python3 intake_data.py --data-dir <data directory> --out-file <output file>
	
	Example command
		python3 intake_data.py --data-dir ./input/all_genes/ --out-file ./output/all_data_and_metadata.cdf

	Inputs
		--data-dir: Path to the directory containing all experimental file(s), metadata file(s), and config file(s) 
		--out-file: path to file (with .cdf extension) that will be created 
	Outputs
		- A single .cdf file containing most information required for the next step


2. Run the correlations and comparisons, supplying the config file, which tells code which thresholds to apply. For larger datasets, use more cores.

	Usage
		python3 run.py --data-source <file_name> --config-file <config file> --out-file <zip directory>		
	
	Example command
	python3 run.py --data-source ./output/all_genes/all_data_and_metadata.cdf --config-file ./input/all_genes/cervical_cancer_config.json --out-file ./output/all_genes/network_output.zip
	
	Inputs
		--data-source: Path to the .cdf file created using intake_data.py
		--config-file: Path to the config file used for intake_data.py
		--out-file: path to zipped directory that will be created
	Outputs
		- A single zipped directory containing the analysis performed



3. Then convert the output files to csv 
	Usage
		python3 to_csv.py --data-file <zip file> --config-file <config file> --out-dir <output directory>
	
	Example command
		python3 to_csv.py --data-file ./output/all_genes/network_output.zip --config-file ./input/all_genes/cervical_cancer_config.json --out-dir ./output/all_genes/network_output
	
	Inputs
		--data-file: .zip file created with run.py
		--config-file: Path to the config file used for intake_data.py
		--out-dir: Path to the directory to output results to

	Outputs
		- all_comparisons.csv: all comparisons made, no statistical thresholds applied to file
		- correlations_bw_signif_measurables.csv: all correlations between parameters that passed differential change threshold. Correlations in this file are not filtered for statistical or causality criteria, but it contains all p-values, whether each edge is unexpected, and whether each edge makes it into the final network after applying statistical and causality criteria
		- network_output_comp.csv: whole network with nodes/edges under the user-defined statistical thresholds, and edges consistent in direction retained (unless otherwise specified in the configuration file). Unexpected edges are also removed from this file.
		- node_comparisons.csv: comparisons performed and found to be statistically significant, values listed in the name are the values of the thresholds applied in the config file
		- config_values.txt: All the user-specified options for making the network

4. Assess the quality of the reconstructed network
	Usage
		python assess_network.py --file <network file>

	Outputs
		- network_quality_assessment.txt: Contains the calculations (also sent to standard output) on the quality of the reconstructed network. Outputs to the same directory the input file is stored in.
		- network.pickle: A pickled file containing the network. Used as input to future steps. Outputs to the same directory the input file is stored in.

5. Calculate network and node properties of the reconstructed network
